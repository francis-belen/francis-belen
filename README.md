# 👋 Welcome to My GitHub

Hi, I'm a passionate software and web developer who has been building personal projects since the early 2010s. Most of my work has been private, offline, or self-hosted — and only recently have I begun migrating parts of it here to GitHub.

### 🔐 About My Repositories

All repositories are **private** by default, reflecting long-term side projects I've been refining since before 2020. If you're interested in seeing or collaborating on any of them, feel free to reach out — I'm happy to share on request.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack & Interests

- **Software Development**: Python, Java, Bash, SQL, PostgreSQL (on Linux systems)
- **Web Development**: PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Other Interests**: Automation, backend systems, data workflows

### 🤝 Let's Connect

I'm always open to feedback, ideas, or collaboration.  
If you'd like to learn more about a specific project or share your thoughts — just drop a message.
